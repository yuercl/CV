CV
============= 
this is my personal curriculum vitae / resume .

Introduction
=============
This is a repository containing my resume compiled in latex using a very nice modern theme. see example [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/examples](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/examples "ctex example")

Prerequisites
=============

You will need to have latex installed on your system. If you are using OSX, the easiest way to get up and running is to download MacTex: [http://tug.org/mactex/](http://tug.org/mactex/ "mactex") . Linux you need install [texlive](http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/CTAN/systems/texlive/Images/ "texlive").

Installation
============

Install Latex and download the moderncv theme. Place the moderncv theme somewhere Latex can find it. You can just place the folder in the same place as your .tex file as I have::

    /my-resume
        my-resume.tex
        my-resume.pdf
        /moderncv

Compiling the Resume
====================

Simply use the ``pdflatex`` command in your terminal::

    pdflatex my-resume.tex

Notes
=====

You are free to take my .tex file and modify it to create your own resume. Please don't use my resume for anything else without my permission, though! 

Good luck...
